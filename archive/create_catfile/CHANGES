CHANGES

make_generic_catfile.pl
 Updated logic to correctly interpret wildcards in file paths in order to find files in subdirectories
below the main. E.g

/root/directory/OBS/auxil
                   /events
                   /events/subdirectory/
                   /events/subdirectory/subsubdirectory

Catalog file generator will now get all files these specified directories


catfile_template_bc_daily.txt

Added logic to get trigger events in subdirectory. To do this, added two lines to catfile template for 
daily BurstCube data

variable TRIG_ID 2[2-9][01][0-9][0-3][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]

AND

filelist events/:TRIG_ID:/bc:OBS_ID:*



NOTE: These changes only apply to daily data (both quicklook and final), and presume all data has 
observation dates no earlier than 2022-01-01 and no later than 2069-12-31. The settings
for transient data do not need any similar adjustments.


v 0.8 (8 Aug 2025)

   Better error trapping and exit if it finds spelling errors (e.g. "categry" instead of "category")
   or other unexpected lines in the template

   Better error reporting on failure to find or resolve keyword values

   Support for using variables in categories. E.g.

category _sgm_:TRIG_ID: .....

   will resolve :TRIG_ID: to the pattern defined earlier in the template (if possible, and exit with an informative error
   message if it fails).

   Explicitly print the program name and version when run (requested feature)
